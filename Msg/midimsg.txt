MIDIMSG is a tiny package that recognises events from a MIDI stream
of bytes, and calls user-defined callback functions appropriately.
This is not very useful by itself but will be useful if you need to
handle MIDI input as part of bigger software.

The code itself is nothing Atari specific. It's optimised for the
68000 processor. Successors (68020 etc.) may use other optimisations
but they are probably not in a bad need of saving a few cycles compared to
a 68000-based computer.

The code tries to give higher priority to realtime events by detecting them
first because they may be related to synchronisation (clock event, song
position, MTC etc.).

Descriptions of the contents:
midimsg.s		m68k assembly source code for Brainstorm Assemble
midimsg.h		Include file for the package.
test.prj		Pure C project file for the test program
test.c			Small test program. It will run some tests through the
				routine then handle any MIDI input from the Atari ST.
midimsg.c		This is how the routine's algorithm was prototyped in C, you
				can look at this to understand the algorithm.
midimsg_test.c	Small test program for midimsg.c. You can compile with 
				gcc midimsg_test.c midimsg.c -o midimsg_test

Have fun !
